# Kamailio - The Open Source SIP Server

Project Website:

  * http://www.kamailio.org

## Overview

Kamailio is an open source implementation of a SIP Signaling Server. SIP is an open standard protocol specified by IETF, the core specification document is [RFC3261](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261).

It is designed for scalability, targeting large deployoments (e.g., for IP telephony operators or carriers, which have a large subscriber base or route a big volume of acalls), but can be also used in enterprises or for personal needs to provide VoIP, Instant Messaging and Presence. Kamailio is well known for its flexibility, robustness, strong security and the extensive number of features - for more, see:

Kamailio was started back in 2001 by Fraunhofer Fokus, a research institute in Berlin, Germany, at that time having the name SIP Express Router (aka SER). In 2005, a fork named OpenSER has been created, which was renamed to Kamailio in July 2008, due to trademark issues. Starting in the autumn of 2008, Kamailio and SER initiated the process to merge the two projects back. After the merge was complete, Kamailio became the main name of the project, being better protected in terms of trademarks.

Fraunhofer Fokus is no longer actively involved in the evolution of the project, Kamailio being now developed and managed by its world wide community. Fokus still uses Kamailio in its research projects (such as OpenIMSCore) and it is hosting events related to the project, such as developer meetings or Kamailio World Conference.
