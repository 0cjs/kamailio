The following modules are not included in CentOS 6 builds because they have
dependencies that cannot be met by the standard CentOS YUM repos, require
complex compilation steps, or are obsolete.

If you need any of these modules you will need to find (and possibly build) and
install the dependencies and then do a manual build of Kamailio.

Ordered by module name:
* acc_radius		requires radiusclient-ng 0.5.0 or higher
* app_java		requires libgcj-4.7 (CentOS 6 contains libgcj-4.4.7)
* app_mono		requires mono-devel
* auth_radius		requires radiusclient-ng 0.5.0 or higher
* carrierroute		requires libconfuse
* db_cassandra		requires thrift 0.6.1 or 0.7.0
* db_oracle		requires instantclient-sdk-10.2.0.3
* dnssec		requires libval
* geoip			requires libgeoip
* iptrtpproxy		requires custom Kernel module builds. If you want to
			use an in-kernel RTP proxy try the rtpproxy-ng module
			along with mediaproxy-ng from SipWise
* jabber		this module is obsolete
* json			requires libjson
* jsonrpc-c		requires libjson
* memcached		requires a different version of libmemcached from that
			available with CentOS 6
* misc_radius		requires radiusclient-ng 0.5.6 or higher
* ndb_redis		requires hiredis
* osp			requires the OSP Toolkit
* peering		requires radiusclient-ng 0.5.0 or higher

* instantclient-sdk-10.2.0.3		db_oracle
* libconfuse				carrierroute
* libgcj-4.7				app_java
* libgeoip				geoip
* libjson				json, jsonrpc-c
* libmemcached (wrong version in EL 6)	memcached
* libval				dnssec
* mono-devel				app_mono
* OSP Toolkit				osp
* radiusclient-ng 0.5.0 or higher	acc_radius, auth_radius, peering
* radiusclient-ng 0.5.6 or higher	misc_radius
