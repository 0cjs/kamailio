SIP-ROUTER modules
==================

This is the first release of the combined project. In order to be able to support
an upgrade path for both Kamailio/OpenSER and SER current users, we have been forced to
provide some modules in two versions, which means that we have three set of modules:

 - modules: 	the SIP router modules
 - modules_k: 	Kamailio modules
 - modules_s: 	SER modules

All modules are compatible with the core, so regardless if you are a new user or 
an existing, you are free to make a choice between the three sets as well as
mix and match between them.

Note that if you are currently using one product, you want to select the module
that exists in the K/S directories first to get a smooth upgrade path.

As sip-router development progress, we will move as many modules as possible
into the core and only keep k/s modules for backwards compatibility when required.

What is a module?
=================
A module consists of a lot of functions that enhance the core. Some of the modules
depends on other modules. It's all properly documented in the README that belongs
to each module (available as web pages on the sip-router.org web site).

A module providers up to three different APIs:

- Enhancements to the core SIP-router routing script (functions)
- Commands for the management interface (MI)
- Development interface for other modules

A single module may provide a selection of this, maybe only one of them.
