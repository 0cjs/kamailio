Hook all transactions?
	register callbacks for TMCB_REQUEST_IN_N & TMCB_RESPONSE_IN_N
	if Call-Info header not found, pass
	might be able to dispense with sca_handle_subscribe().

	performance penalty: cost of check for Call-Info on each transaction.
OR

check for Call-Info header in script, call "sca_call_info_update"
	must be done in onreply route, too
	more prone to bugs because of missed cases
	easy to misconfigure, potentially leading to low adoption

To consider:
    * What to do when a subscriber reSUBSCRIBES and the dialog is different
      from the current saved subscription? Avoiding shm_realloc seems like a
      good idea, so perhaps just delete the current one and save the new.
