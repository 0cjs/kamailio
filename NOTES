Hook all transactions?
	register callbacks for TMCB_REQUEST_IN_N & TMCB_RESPONSE_IN_N
	if Call-Info header not found, pass
	might be able to dispense with sca_handle_subscribe().

	performance penalty: cost of check for Call-Info on each transaction.
OR

check for Call-Info header in script, call "sca_call_info_update"
	must be done in onreply route, too
	more prone to bugs because of missed cases
	easy to misconfigure, potentially leading to low adoption


To consider:
    * What to do when a subscriber reSUBSCRIBES and the dialog is different
      from the current saved subscription? Avoiding shm_realloc seems like a
      good idea, so perhaps just delete the current one and save the new.

      Update: separate shm_alloc for dialog.id in sca_subscription_create,
	      then shm_free & shm_alloc if differing dialog found.


How to remove Call-Info header before relaying?
    Use del_lump from ../../data_lump.h	
    Cf. textops module's remove_hf_f()

How to detect hold/pickup in SDP?
    Use parse_sdp/free_sdp from ../../parser/sdp/sdp.h.
    
	sdp_stream_cell_t	*sdp_stream;
	
	/* puts sdp_info_t pointer in msg->body */
	rc = parse_sdp( msg );
	if ( rc < 0 ) {
	    error;
	}
	/* msg->body must now be free_sdp'd */

	/* for now we'll just assume a single stream per call */
	sdp_stream = get_sdp_stream( msg, 0, 0 );

	if ( sdp->is_on_hold ) {
	    ....
	}
	
		

Call-Info meaning in context
    If present, refers to appearance associated with the Contact URI.

    e.g., a Call-Info header present in an INVITE indicates the caller
    has appearance-index N and is using the line to place a call.

    e.g., a Call-Info header present in a response indicates the callee
    has appearance-index N
