Hook all transactions?
	register callbacks for TMCB_REQUEST_IN_N & TMCB_RESPONSE_IN_N
	if Call-Info header not found, pass
	might be able to dispense with sca_handle_subscribe().
	performance penalty: cost of check for Call-Info on each transaction.

    OR

check for Call-Info header in script, call "sca_call_info_update"
	must be done in onreply route, too
	more prone to bugs because of missed cases
	easy to misconfigure, potentially leading to low adoption


To consider:
    * What to do when a subscriber reSUBSCRIBES and the dialog is different
      from the current saved subscription? Avoiding shm_realloc seems like a
      good idea, so perhaps just delete the current one and save the new.

      Update: separate shm_alloc for dialog.id in sca_subscription_create,
	      then shm_free & shm_alloc if differing dialog found.


How to remove Call-Info header before relaying?
    Use del_lump from ../../data_lump.h	
    Cf. textops module's remove_hf_f()

How to detect hold/pickup in SDP?
    Use parse_sdp/free_sdp from ../../parser/sdp/sdp.h.
    
	sdp_stream_cell_t	*sdp_stream;
	
	/* puts sdp_info_t pointer in msg->body */
	rc = parse_sdp( msg );
	if ( rc < 0 ) {
	    error;
	}
	/* msg->body must now be free_sdp'd */

	/* for now we'll just assume a single stream per call */
	sdp_stream = get_sdp_stream( msg, 0, 0 );

	if ( sdp->is_on_hold ) {
	    ....
	}
	
		

Call-Info meaning in context
    If present, refers to appearance associated with the Contact URI.

    e.g., a Call-Info header present in an INVITE indicates the caller
    has appearance-index N and is using the line to place a call.

    e.g., a Call-Info header present in a response indicates the callee
    has appearance-index N



INVITE response handler doesn't handle non 18x/200 replies. Leaves stuck state.


A reINVITE from another line in the SCA group has the following characteristics:
    * RURI is the SCA line's AoR, not the callee.
    * From and To URIs are also SCA line's AoR.
	    * SCA provides very limited way to pass callee info: only
	      in NOTIFY's appearance-uri, which is for display purposes.
    * From-tag and Call-ID are new. There is no to-tag.
    * A Call-Info header is present with the appearance-index the line is
      attempting to retrieve from hold.


Revisiting possibility of using TMCB_ tm module hooks.
    TMCB_E2EACK_IN is called when an ACK matching a 200OK-answered INVITE
    is received. Could use this to send out call-info NOTIFYs when an SCA
    line answers a call. Bug right now is that the NOTIFYs are sent out
    before the proxy has CANCELed the INVITEs to the other members of the
    group. Seems the handsets are dumping the line state when they get the
    CANCELs, so the appearance goes away. On next reSUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY, the
    handsets get the correct state again.

    Using TCMB_REQ_IN is a viable option. It would allow for eliminating
    the use of exported functions to the script. Second rev? Probably
    more efficient than using exported functions.


Dependency on To-URI is problematic for hold/pickup
    An SCA pickup of a held call on another handset means RURI, From-URI
    and To-URI are identical. The module currently expects those to
    be unique. It will be possible to reconcile these, but it suggests
    that using the sip_uri_t struct and the parse_uri functions may be
    helpful.
